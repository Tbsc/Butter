 * Proxy interface. Uses the {@link IInitiable} interface to create a predictable load cycle using API methods.
 * PreInit type parameter is {@link FMLPreInitializationEvent}, init is {@link FMLInitializationEvent}, post init

 *
 * Any additional proxy calls need to be added separately from {@link IInitiable}, as {@link IInitiable} only
